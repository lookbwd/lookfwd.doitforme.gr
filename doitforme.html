    <h1>What is <a href="http://www.doitforme.gr/" target="_blank"><img src="images/doitforme.gif" width="129" height="25" border="0" align="absmiddle"></a>?</h1>
    <p>doitforme.gr is a way to organize, promote, market and support products 
      and services that I and my colleagues do for others. It's the business I've 
      been running since 2002 and I know it like the back of my hand. It's based 
      in three key concepts that produced many great products and satisfied customers 
      all these years.</p>
    <p><img src="images/doitfor_p1.jpg" width="104" height="79" align="left">1. 
      <strong>Save me from disaster!</strong> This is a two step process. You 
      see that you have made some bad decisions. You have certain responsibilities 
      that you can't handle your own because of many reasons e.g. lack of knowledge, 
      lack of time or unforeseen - unexpected events. Deadlines are tight, you 
      lose time to market constraints or your semester faces lack of failure. 
      What can you do now? What you want at this moment is to find someone to 
      tell him, &quot;do it for me&quot;! That's what doitforme.gr does for you. 
      It will save you from failure just the right moment. </p>
    <p><img src="images/doitfor_p2.jpg" width="104" height="78" align="left">2. 
      <strong>You have the idea, but is it right?</strong> 90% of the ideas we 
      hear everyday have the concept, have the potential customers... but do not 
      work! (I hate things that don't work). Why? Because they can not be get 
      together within a reasonable business model. That there are a lot of problems 
      that one can't see when he has a &quot;great idea&quot; that will make him 
      millionaire. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>There are many ideas that have too many hidden costs that businessmen 
        can't see on the beginning. Technicians may know but no one ever asks... 
        The result is a disaster. Many ideas are excellent but there is a lack 
        of infrastructure to support them. For example Greek Internet isn't fast 
        enough to support many applications that may run excellent in other countries. 
        Another example is the high price of GPRS services that makes a lot of 
        applications non realizable.</li>
      <li> Legal issues. While your business is a small one, you don't have any 
        of these problems. But when you will start having some tenths of competitors 
        you will pray that you had a legal product. You won't be able to raise 
        the price just because product A is legal while what I've been selling 
        you all this time (product B) was illegal. Will your price be competitive 
        for your legalized product? Information Technology products have a lot 
        of legal issues that are hard to be solved by non-experts. In addition 
        local laws different significantly so it's not as easy as it looks to 
        &quot;import&quot; a product, service or idea.</li>
      <li> You can do everything, I know... But are you sure you can do everything? 
        Even more, are you sure that you WANT to do everything? Are you sure that 
        you want to do funding, programming, law practice, marketing, distribution 
        and support for your product or service? Do you have the partners to make 
        all these come true? How many and what kind of persons will you need for 
        realizing your idea and make money out of it? Is it still profitable after 
        realizing that you won't do everything yourself? What services exist to 
        help you? Even if you have relative experience in other fields (e.g. retail 
        sales), you will find moving to Information Technology extremely difficult.</li>
      <li> Are you in the right country? Are you sure that it's profitable to 
        make development or assembly of your product or service in your host country? 
        How much could you save if you were able to make production somewhere 
        else and what are the conditions that will make such a decision right?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is where consulting services come into play. And the most important 
      is that you can have them for free. If your business isn't large enough, 
      you won't have enough to pay (and it won't be meaningful to pay) for a specialized 
      IT consulting service. So, in order to make the distinction, let's call 
      consulting, &quot;consulting&quot; and what doitforme.gr does (for free), 
      &quot;discussion&quot;. Discussion means no guarantees, no reports, and 
      no commitment. It means that you talk, doitforme.gr hears and asks questions 
      until it understands completely what you have in mind. Then it makes a simple 
      research and talks to you giving you confidence that you know 95% about 
      what your Information Technology product or service will cost you, what 
      loyal conflictions may arise, how many and what kind of people - partners 
      you will need, where is the best place to make the production and if your 
      plan is in the correct order and realizable. For the rest 5% you will have 
      to buy some consulting. Even then you won't get any guarantees, just more 
      confidence. It's your business after all!</p>
    <p><img src="images/doitfor_p3.jpg" width="104" height="78" align="left"><strong>3. 
      You have the idea, it's right, you have the customers (it may be just you), 
      but you don't have the knowledge.</strong> Ok, this happens every day. Obviously 
      what you want is someone to tell him, &quot;do it for me&quot;. This is 
      where we both will make money and it's where doitforme.gr is clear with 
      you. <strong>doitforme doesn't make production and this is very important.</strong> 
      doitforme.gr does development. This means that doitforme's primary concern 
      is to minimize production cost and lower time to market according to customers' 
      needs. </p>
    <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="box">
      <tr> 
        <td>Most production companies have small departments that make development. 
          Their concern is to take maximum advantage of the low cost resources 
          available in the company to minimize <strong>their</strong> cost. If 
          they can do the job with 4 microcontrollers that they can buy for 1$ 
          but in the retail they cost 4$ and just half an hour of programming 
          with the one and only coder of the company you will end up with a board 
          that costs 16$/piece. Thay may charge you almost nothing, but is this 
          to your advantage? If you want 4 pieces it's OK but if you want more 
          then this extra cost per piece must be considered seriously. 
          <p>The most important problem is that if you aren't an Electrical Engineering 
            expert, you will never understand that you have been cheated. In fact 
            you haven't been cheated and that's why you lose and you can't do 
            anything about it. The company, being more expert than you in this 
            field, did what it had to do. Made money and promoted its own products 
            while at the same time reduced its risks. Investing in development 
            increases the risks of the company because no one will give this money 
            back if for some unknown reason you decide not to proceed or stop 
            after the first 100 pieces. And in fact you may be forced to stop 
            early... Why? Because you have a product that costs at least 3 times 
            more than minimum at the time it was released! Of course if beyond 
            price you become extremely successful and you don't quit after some 
            months, the company can make some extra development and release competitive 
            products with 1/3 of the price. This will kick you off the market 
            within months (This happens all the time with Chinese assembly companies, 
            &quot;Hey these shoes look exactly like Nike!&quot;). Investing in 
            development guards you, your profit and competence of your product. 
            So... </p></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p align="center"><strong>Do invest in development, do buy the source code, 
      schematics e.t.c., do explicit contracts for your exclusiveness of your 
      product.</strong></p>
    <p>All these three are provided by doitforme.gr for both software and hardware 
      - embedded projects. doitforme.gr does development and not production. In 
      addition it provides many flexible ways for paying the development in order 
      to get exactly what you need with minimum cost and risk from your side. 
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li> In software engineering projects most customers want something and 
        don't mind to market it themselves. So the development is being done for 
        you for really low price but we reserve the right to market the product 
        ourselves.</li>
      <li> You may also want some months of exclusiveness because the product 
        will give you an advantage in the market but you still don't care for 
        marketing it yourself. Ok, the development is being done for a minimum 
        of price and you can buy months of explicitness. Then we can market it 
        ourselves.</li>
      <li>If you still want to market it yourself, that's fine! We develop it, 
        you pay the full cost of development and you take not only some prototypes 
        but also the full source code - schematics e.c.t. and the right to market 
        it exclusively.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Fair, isn't it?</p>
