    <h2>CV Highlights</h2>
    <p>I was born in Athens in 1982. 17 years latter, I graduated from Varvakio 
      Lyceum of Athens. In the meanwhile I&#8217;ve keeping myself busy doing 
      nice little electronics projects with analog/digital circuits and small 
      microprocessors (PIC, AVR). 1999 was one of the most important years of 
      my life. I was in Paros island for summer vacations when my parents called 
      and told me I've been accepted at the Applied Mathematics and Physics faculty 
      of <a href="http://www.ntua.gr/" target="_blank">National Technical University 
      of Athens</a> the leading university of Greece.</p>
    <p> Amazing news, but it wasn't before May 2000 that I got actively involved 
      to the academic research by travelling to Pylos and contributing to the 
      NESTOR (Neutrino Extended Submarine Telescope with Oceanographic Research) 
      project. My next project was also oceanographic related. In July 2002 I 
      worked for <a href="http://www.hcmr.gr/" target="_blank">NCMR (National 
      Centre for Marine Research)</a> and my good friend Dr Vasilis Zervakis in 
      the development of a data logging system for the weather station of the 
      <a href="http://www.hcmr.gr/english_site/services/shi_sub_rovs/ships_subs_rovs.html" target="_blank">Aigaion</a> 
      oceanographic research vessel.</p>
    <p> In June 2003 I was represented our University in the Summer Student programme 
      at <a href="http://www.cern.ch/" target="_blank">CERN</a>, &quot;The world's 
      largest particle physics laboratory... where the web was born&quot;! It 
      was an amazing experience and you can find more info <a href="http://lookfwd.doit4me.gr/cern.htm">in 
      the CERN page</a> of my web site.</p>
    <p> Once I returned, in September 2003, I worked for <a href="http://harmoniqua.wau.nl/" target="_blank">the 
      HarmoniQuA project</a> and developed the JAVA edition of <a href="http://lookfwd.doitforme.gr/projects.php?show=quideline#quideline">the 
      &quot;Guideline tool&quot;</a> (<a href="http://harmoniqua.wau.nl/public/most/consulting_glossary.htm" target="_blank">Guideline 
      and Glossary</a>) which later evolved to the MOST tool. In December 2003 
      I developed the <a href="http://lookfwd.doitforme.gr/projects.php?show=registry#registry">client-tire 
      JAVA GIS interface</a> for the &quot;Olive and Vineyard Registry of Greece&quot; 
      of the <a href="http://www.minagric.gr/" target="_blank">Ministry of Agriculture 
      of Greece</a>. This tool manages this complex Oracle Geodatabase and can 
      present and edit fields all over Greece with detail level of a single olive 
      tree. Thank god, it doesn&#8217;t include every single olive!</p>
    <p> In October 2004 after <a href="projects.html">these</a> 
      and many more projects, 63 courses and endless exams, I graduated from 
      the National Technical University of Athens on-time and on budget ;). Apart 
      from the great experience of programming a powerful DSP (<a href="http://www.analog.com/technology/dsp/Blackfin/" target="_blank">Analog 
      Devices' BlackFin</a>) as <a href="http://lookfwd.doitforme.gr/projects.php?show=blackfin#blackfin">my 
      thesis project</a> and the strong mathematics background I should mention 
      the most precious thing I earned during these years; working with two great 
      professors <a href="http://www.physics.ntua.gr/Faculty/dris/" target="_blank">Dr. 
      Manolis Dris</a> and <a href="http://www.physics.ntua.gr/Faculty/theoalex/" target="_blank">Dr. 
      Theodoros Alexopoulos</a>. I would like to thank them very much for their 
      support during and after my studies.</p>
    <p> In October 2006 I completed the <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/admissions/pg/micro_systems_design.php" target="_blank">MSc 
      in Microelectronics Systems Design</a> (System on Chip stream) from the 
      <a href="http://www.soton.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Southampton</a>, 
      the top UK University on this subject. The course included several interesting 
      projects like designing, creating layout, testing and generating software 
      tools for a <a href="http://lookfwd.doit4me.gr/projects.php?show=moufa#moufa">microprocessor</a> 
      completely from ground up, <a href="http://lookfwd.doit4me.gr/projects.php?show=timing_attacks#timing_attacks">advanced 
      cryptographic attacks</a> and a <a href="http://lookfwd.doit4me.gr/projects.php?show=swcost#swcost">software 
      power estimation</a> suite. <a href="http://lookfwd.doit4me.gr/projects.php?show=core_services#core_services">My 
      dissertation</a> was on (simply put) creating a framework for writing and 
      reusing quickly components for FPGAs that get re-configured at run-time. 
      This framework was designed with Networks-on-Chip in mind and was inspired 
      by web-services technology.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m in Cambridge, UK working for <a href="http://www.arm.com/" target="_blank">ARM</a>, modelling the world&#8217;s most successful embedded CPUs.</p>
    <p> So, what's next? Nobody knows!</p>
