To optimize an MS-DOS program 

Double - click My Computer. 
Locate and select the program you want to optimize. 
On the File menu, click Properties.
The settings you specify will be used each time you start the program by double - clicking its icon. If you start the program from an MS-DOS window, these settings won't be used. 

Notes 
To specify whether MS-DOS starts in a full screen or in a window, change the Run properties on the Program tab. Note that some MS-DOS - based programs cannot run in a window. 
The MS-DOS Prompt Properties dialog box replaces the PIF Editor used in earlier versions of Windows.
