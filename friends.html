    <h1>Friends </h1>
    <p>I&#8217;m sorry dear friends but I have to present you in alphabetical 
      order. I don&#8217;t have time to set any other order&#8230; I don&#8217;t 
      have time to present any female friends as well (they would somehow misinterpret 
      their existence and even more their non-existence in this list). Anyway, 
      we all know it will be an incomplete list no matter how hard I try!</p>
    <h2>Alexopoulos Theodoros</h2>
    <h2> Argyros Tassos </h2>
    <p>Truly a genius! I&#8217;m sure he will make it to the top and even higher. 
      In fact it isn&#8217;t only that he is very clever and organizational. It&#8217;s 
      more that he always takes the hard way home and by being extremely focused, 
      he achieves to gain valuable experience very fast. <br>
      Distinguishing feature: Confidence</p>
    <h2> Athanasiou George</h2>
    <p>We are friends since high school. Although we have lost touch a little 
      these last years, he is still one of the most important personalities and 
      in fact it seems that we agree to most of our opinions. I&#8217;m sure that 
      our personal histories will meet again in the near future.<br>
      Distinguishing feature: Humor</p>
    <h2>Baxevanis Alexander</h2>
    <p>Since we first met (early 1998) we have been best friends. Why? Because 
      our temperaments are completely different! It&#8217;s extremely interesting 
      to talk to Alexander because you will always be presented a completely different 
      view about everything (while I will present a really strange view)! No need 
      to tell that he has been the only person that would help whenever I&#8217;ve 
      needed help. Distinguishing feature: Social</p>
    <h2> Dris Manolis</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Katseris John</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Mpetzios Panagiwtis</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><a href="http://www.intp.doitforme.gr/">Swtiris Fragkiskos</a></h2>
    <p>Distinguishing feature: Introvert</p>

  <div class="comments"><!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="comments" --> 
    <p><strong>What do all my friends have in common?</strong><br>
      Appart from knowing me, all my friends share a single thing: They are ALL 
      exceptional; no ordinary Greeks! They are all special and if you meet them, 
      you will understand exactly what i'm talking about.</p>
