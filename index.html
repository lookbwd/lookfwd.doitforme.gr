    <h1>Welcome to my web site.</h1>
    <p>My name is Dimitris Kouzis - Loukas and I'm glad to meet you in my personal 
      web site. I'm going to introduce myself and help you find the information 
      you are looking for.</p>
    <h2>I am commited to a single purpose: To make things work.</h2>
    <p>No matter what specific tasks dictate, the methodology of engineering problem 
      solving is global and applies to everything from Embedded Systems to Education 
      and Politics. Successfully attacking a problem may require special knowledge, 
      effective use of feedback, best practices, skills, partners and the most 
      important, epxerience. Appart from these, behind every successful project 
      there is an artistic strugle for perfection that doesn't stop till the &quot;artist&quot; 
      is completely satisfied.</p>
    <h2>In this site...</h2>
    <p>In this site you will find my personal success and less success stories. 
      All of them share a common attribute: They work. </p>
    <p>You will enjoy the projects section. There you can find academic projects 
      as well as professionaly used projects mainly regarding software and hardware 
      design and implementaion. Furthermore, hobby projects can be described as 
      projects without strict deadlines but interesting as well.</p>
    <p>In the CERN section you will find information about one of the most important 
      experiences of my life. My participation to the summer student programme 
      2002 at CERN, Geneva, Switcherland. Stories that deserve to be memorized.</p>
    <p>My friends strongly affect my life flow. Few of them have affected my life 
      very much. They are presented in the friends section of this site.</p>
    <p>In the activities section you can find some activities I'm interested in 
      and I either participate or I would like to when my schedule allows.</p>
    <p>In the blog section you will find the most frequently updated content of 
      this site including news about the full range of my activities and comments 
      on what's happening arround.</p>
    <p>Finally via the Contact section you will find ways to contact me and of 
      course schedule availability.</p>
    <h2>I would like to thank you and wish a nice time exploring my web site</h2>
